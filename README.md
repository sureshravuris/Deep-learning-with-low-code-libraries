# **Deep-learning-with-low-code-libraries**

## Introduction

This repository is a comprehensive collection of various machine learning tasks implemented using FastAI, Hugging Face Transformers, Keras-NLP, and Keras-CV. It is designed to showcase the implementation and results of different tasks such as object detection, segmentation, tabular data processing, recommendation systems, text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, text summarization, translation, zero-shot classification, and more using the aforementioned libraries. This project aims to serve as an insightful and helpful resource for learners and practitioners alike.

## Project Structure

- **FastAI**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for vision object detection, segmentation, tabular tasks, and recommendation systems using FastAI.
- **Huggingface_Transformers API**: Includes implementations for text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, text summarization, translation, zero-shot classification, computer vision tasks, audio processing, and table QA using Hugging Face Transformers.
- **Keras_NLP**: Showcases the use of Keras-NLP for NLP tasks including inference with a pretrained classifier, fine-tuning a pretrained backbone, and custom model fine-tuning.
- **Keras_CV**: Demonstrates object detection using the YOLO model, inference, fine-tuning, and training classifiers from scratch with Keras-CV


## Resources Used
